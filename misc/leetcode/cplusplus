In C++, a structure is same as class except the following differences:

1) Members of a class are private by default and members of struct are public by default.
For example program 1 fails in compilation and program 2 works fine

2) When deriving a struct from a class/struct, default access-specifier for a base class/struct is public. And when deriving a class, default access specifier is private.
For example program 3 fails in compilation and program 4 works fine.

A class declaration can contain static object of self type, it can also have pointer to self type, but it cannot have a non-static object of self type.

Size of an empty class is not zero. It is 1 byte generally. It is nonzero to ensure that the two different objects will have different addresses. See the following example.


we cannot pass constant variable for reference
