What is a file system??/



how is it organized:-

struct datablock   { char datablock[MAX];}

struct Inode  {
		vector<int> datablocks;
}

struct metadata{
		char last_modified;
		char last_attributes;
}


map<string,inode *> fbase;

struct filename{
	vector<inode *> nodes;
	Metadata metadata;
}


The POSIX standard mandates filesystem behavior that is strongly influenced by traditional UNIX filesystems. Regular files must have the following attributes:
The size of the file in bytes.
Device ID (this identifies the device containing the file).
The User ID of the file's owner.
The Group ID of the file.
The file mode which determines the file type and how the file's owner, its group, and others can access the file.
Additional system and user flags to further protect the file (limit its use and modification).
Timestamps telling when the inode itself was last modified (ctime, inode change time), the file content last modified (mtime, modification time), and last accessed (atime, access time).
A link count telling how many hard links point to the inode.
Pointers to the disk blocks that store the file's contents (see inode pointer structure).
The stat system call retrieves a file's inode number and some of the information in the inode.
